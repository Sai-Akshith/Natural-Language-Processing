Ex 1 : Perform the following task using NLTK: Tokenize and tag some text, identify named entities, display a parse tree and find the ambiguity of the sentence using parse tree.
Ex 2 : Perform t-Test and Chi-Square test to check whether a given sequence of words is a collocation or not.
Ex 3 : Implement the decision rule-based Na√Øve Bayes disambiguation method to find the sense of an ambiguous word with the given training set.
Ex 4 : Implement the Hindle and Rooth algorithm for solving the attachment ambiguity problem.
Ex 5 : Implement the forward and backward procedures using Hidden Markov Model to find the probability of a word sequence.
Ex 6 : Implement the Viterbi algorithm to find the probability of a word sequence, and infer the best tag sequence using Hidden Markov Model.
Ex 7 : Implement the Probabilistic Context Free Grammar (PCFG) and find the inside probability of a word sequence using the CYK algorithm.
Ex 8 : Implement text classification using Bag of Words and TF-IDF with TensorFlow.
Ex 9 : Implement word2vec model to explore the semantic similarity between the words.
